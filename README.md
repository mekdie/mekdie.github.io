# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository is for my personal portfolio website, which is currently under development. At this stage, the website features a **Linktree-style** layout, offering links to my various social media and professional profiles, such as:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/mekdie)
- [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mcdony-lee-angkasa-7a9b81187)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/mcdonylee)
- and more...

## Current Features

- A simple and clean interface displaying links to my professional and personal online presence.
- Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for better performance and type safety.

## Future Plans

In the future, this portfolio will evolve into a comprehensive website showcasing:

- Projects Iâ€™ve worked on.
- My skills and technologies I specialize in.
- My professional experience and achievements.
- A contact form for potential collaborations or job opportunities.

Stay tuned for updates as the website grows!
